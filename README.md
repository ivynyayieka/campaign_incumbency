# campaign_incumbency
This is an analysis of campaign finance data from [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/). 

The analysis seeks to see how incumbency affects campaign financing. 

The analysis finds that in recent years some individuals taking on high profile incumbents saw a fundraising bonanza, sometimes raising more than the incumbents.
